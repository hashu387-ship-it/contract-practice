RICS APC COACHING - COMPLETE STUDY GUIDE
CONTRACT PRACTICE & CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
================================================================================

Candidate: Mohamed Hassan
Position: Senior Quantity Surveyor and Cost Manager
Company: First Fix KSA, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia
Projects: Red Sea Global developments (Sports Entertainment District, Hotel Projects)
Contract Experience: FIDIC 1987, FIDIC 1999, PWA General Conditions

================================================================================
MY STATEMENT OF EXPERIENCE (SOE) - CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
================================================================================

LEVEL 1:
I have gained my knowledge of Contract Administration through various sources,
including books, articles, academic discussions, and CPD events. As a post-contract
quantity surveyor, I learned about contractual mechanisms such as payment procedures,
insurance requirements, variation procedures, claims procedures, bonds and guarantees,
MOS, roles and responsibilities, and time extensions. My experience includes working
with FIDIC 1987, PWA General Conditions of Contracts, and attending CPDs on FIDIC 1999.

LEVEL 2:
As a post-contract quantity surveyor in a Red Sea villa development project, one of
my primary duties was to certify materials on-site before issuing certification for
interim payment. Initially, I verified if the materials had already been delivered
to the site and if the Engineer had approved them. I then obtained confirmation that
the materials had been securely stored and safely at the site. Next, I ensured that
the listed materials were included in the contract for future permanent works of the
project. Finally, I certified the due and payable amount based on the actual invoice
for the listed materials, as per the percentage mentioned in the appendices to the
tender. Additionally, I have been directly involved in issuing certification for
interim payment applications, advance payments, final accounts, the release of
retention, variations, and administering provisional sums in accordance with the
contract provisions.

PART 1: THEORY NOTES - CONTRACT PRACTICE & CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
================================================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SECTION 1: FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTRACT PRACTICE vs CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION
--------------------------------------------

CONTRACT PRACTICE:
Refers to the processes and activities involved in the creation, negotiation,
and formulation of a contract BEFORE its execution.

CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION:
Involves the implementation, execution, and management of the contract terms
and conditions AFTER the contract has been signed and becomes effective.


AGREEMENT vs CONTRACT
---------------------

AGREEMENT:
- A mutual understanding between two or more parties about their rights and
  responsibilities
- Reflects a meeting of the minds or consensus on specific terms
- An agreement itself is not necessarily legally binding unless it satisfies
  the legal requirements of a contract
- Example: If two friends agree to share a ride to work or coffee

CONTRACT:
- A binding agreement between two or more persons which creates mutual rights
  and duties, and which are enforceable by law
- There must be an intention to create a legal relationship
- Main object of a contract is legal consequences
- Contract can be written or oral


ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF A VALID CONTRACT
--------------------------------------

1. OFFER - Details on what will be provided - by one party

2. ACCEPTANCE - Unqualified acceptance by the other party [oral, written or conduct]

3. CONSIDERATION - As an outcome for the agreement – Ex: Money or the project to client

4. CAPACITY - Age and mentality

5. INTENTION - To create a legal relationship – Ex: carry out the promises

6. GENUINE CONSENT / FREE CONSENT - Ex: there must be no force involved

7. MUST BE POSSIBLE - By the parties

8. REMEDIES FOR BREACH - When a contract is breached, the non-breaching party is
   entitled for remedy

9. MUST BE LEGAL - Ex: an agreement to defraud is not valid

10. PRIVITY OF CONTRACT - Only the parties involved in the contract have the rights
    and obligations

    be discharged by performance, agreement, frustration, or breach

It includes:
- Accepted Tender
- The scope
- Conditions of Contract

SECTION 7: BONDS AND GUARANTEES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS A BOND?
---------------
A promise, usually in writing, that one person (the bondsman) will pay another
person (the employer) a certain amount of money. The bondsman only becomes
obliged to make payment when called on to do so.


TWO TYPES OF BONDS
------------------

1. DEFAULT BOND (GUARANTEE):
   - Conditional - Contractor must first commit a default under the contract
     with proof
   - Examples: Performance guarantee, Parent company guarantee

2. ON-DEMAND BOND:
   - Unconditional – they don't require any proof of default for the employer
     to make demand for payment
   - Examples:
     * Tender bonds – if the selected contractor refused to enter into the
       contract this will be used to call for retendering
     * Advance payment bonds – to protect and recover the paid advance payment
       in any critical situation
     * Retention bond – if the contractor wants all the retention amount or
       the parties agreed to keep Retention bond


KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GUARANTEE AND BOND
-----------------------------------------
In guarantee, the first obligation is for the contractor to fulfil its obligations.
But in a bond, bank has an obligation to pay without waiting contractor's action.


PERFORMANCE BOND
----------------
- An independent financial surety (often a bank or insurance company) provides
  this bond in favor of the Employer
- The contractor pays a premium to the surety, which is usually recovered from
  the developer under the building contract
- Typically 10% of contract sum
- Expires at practical completion

Advantages:
- Independent so any insolvency of group of company will not impact
- If no parent company this is well useful

Disadvantages:
- Charges to the developer or client
- 10% contract sum only can be covered
- Expires at practical completion


PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEE (PCG)
------------------------------
A parent or another group company of the contractor grants a guarantee in favor
of the Employer. The guarantor ensures the contractor's performance under the
building contract.

Advantages:
- No financial cap (it is advisable to agree on the cap for financial liability)
- No time limit (until completion)
- No cost to the developer

Disadvantages:
- Insolvency of parent company may impact


CONTRACTOR FAILED TO PROVIDE PERFORMANCE BOND (But Client Wants to Continue)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Actions to take:
- Explain the client about the risk of this failure and the benefits of
  performance bond
- Encourage the contractor to submit performance bond
- Encourage the contractor to complete 10% of work and Client can get bond
- Suggestion to the Client to agree with the contractor to have more retention amount
- Request for parent company guarantee


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  injury or property damage


EMPLOYER'S LIABILITY INSURANCE / WORKER'S COMPENSATION INSURANCE

Umbrella insurance gives you more protection if you have a big claim that goes
over the limits of your insurance. So, if you have a claim that costs SAR 2 million,
